Currently, the [MEO Cloud][mc] desktop application consists of three main components:

1.	GUI layer
1.	File Manager Extension
1.	Synchronization Core (a.k.a. "sync core" or just "core")

The GUI and File Manager Extension components provide the user-visible part of the application. The GUI controls every aspect of the sync core functionality. The File Manager Extension improves integration with Desktop Managers by providing a contextual menu and status overlay icons for each file in the synchronized folder.

The synchronization core is responsible for keeping the contents of the local MEOCloud folder in sync with the MEO Cloud service.

In order to encourage developers to take advantage of our service, we've decided to release the source to a CLI interface to the synchronization core that exposes as much functionality as possible (selective sync, notifications, registration and local filesystem awareness).

You can browse the CLI interface source code [here][repo], or check it out immediately by doing:

<pre class="prettyprint">
git clone https://github.com/sapo/meocloud-cli.git
</pre>


You can also obtain builds of [MEO Cloud][mc] client software for a number of different operating systems and architectures (including ARM) from our [official download page][dls].
